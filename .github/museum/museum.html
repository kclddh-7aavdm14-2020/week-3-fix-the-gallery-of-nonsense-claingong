<h2 id="Content">Content of The McCord Museum</h2>
<p>On October 13, 1921, the McCord National Museum, 
   then known as the McCord National Museum, moved
   to the former McGill Union Building. Percy Erskine 
   Nobbs (Percy Erskine Nobbs) followed the arts and crafts tradition Design, 
   the collection is based on the collection of the McCord family. Since 1878, 
   David Ross McCord has been adding to the already considerable collection 
   that his family has collected since they came to Canada. Over the years, 
   he formulated a plan to establish a National History Museum in Montreal, 
   the then Canadian metropolis.

   <p>The building where the museum is now has been managed by McGill University 
       for more than sixty years and was the seat of the Student Union at that time. 
       After the riots targeting SSMU caused the building to be destroyed and several 
       administrators were taken hostage, McGill University began to build a safer
       building-the University Center, which is now the location of SSMU. Over the years, 
       key members of the community have supported the museum. Today, the McCord Museum has 
       received support from the governments of Canada, Quebec, and Montreal, as well as the 
       support of its members, donors and sponsors.
